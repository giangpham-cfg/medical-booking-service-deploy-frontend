# Medical Booking Service Application

## Overview

The Medical Booking Service Application is an online platform that enables patients to conveniently book medical appointments. The application streamlines the process of searching for medical professionals by specialty, location, and clinic center. I developed this application as a SERN full-stack project to enhance and push my coding skills to the next level.
